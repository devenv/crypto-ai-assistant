## The Monitoring Loop (Run Daily or During Volatility)

### **Phase 1: Get the Current State**

**1. Check Portfolio & Open Orders:**
   - Get a complete snapshot of what you hold and what orders are pending.
     ```bash
     python main.py account info --min-value 0
     python main.py account orders
     ```

### **Phase 2: Verify Against Your Plan**

**2. Compare with `current_plan.md`:**
   - Open your `current_plan.md` file.
   - **A. Check for Filled Orders:** Have any of your `OPEN` orders been filled?
   - **B. Verify Stop-Losses:** For **every asset you hold**, is there a corresponding `OCO` order active? If a position is unprotected, proceed to Phase 3.

### **Phase 3: Take Action on Discrepancies**

This phase covers actions to take when your live portfolio state diverges from `current_plan.md`.

**A. The Post-Fill Drill (For Newly Acquired Assets):**
   - If you discover a filled buy order with no corresponding protection, execute these steps:
   - **1. Confirm Exact Balance:** Run `python main.py account info --min-value 0` again to get the *precise* quantity of the new asset.
   - **2. Check Lot Size:** Run `python main.py exchange lotsize <SYMBOL>` to confirm quantity precision. Round your balance *down* to the correct number of decimal places.
   - **3. Place a Single OCO Order:** Place one OCO order to protect the entire new position as defined in your plan.
     ```bash
     # Example: Placing a protective OCO for a new SOL position of 3.868
     python main.py order place-oco SOLUSDT 3.868 180 155.50
     ```
   - **4. Update `current_plan.md`:** After the OCO is successfully placed, **IMMEDIATELY** update the plan. Mark the buy order as `FILLED` and the new OCO order as `PLACED`.
   - **‚ö†Ô∏è NO EXCEPTIONS:** Never skip this step - an outdated plan will cause confusion and potential losses.

**B. General Discrepancy Resolution:**
   - For other discrepancies (e.g., a missing asset, duplicate orders, incorrect stop-loss levels), the process is:
   - **1. Identify the Action:** Determine what needs to be done. If an asset from the plan is missing, investigate its history to see if it was sold.
     ```bash
     python main.py account history <SYMBOL>
     ```
     - **‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT:** Use the full trading pair symbol (e.g., `ETHUSDT`, `BTCUSDT`, `SOLUSDT`), not just the coin name.
     - **Examples:**
       ```bash
       python main.py account history ETHUSDT --limit 10
       python main.py account history BTCUSDT --limit 5
       python main.py account history SOLUSDT
       ```
   - **2. Execute the Command:** Run the appropriate command (e.g., `order cancel`).
   - **3. Update `current_plan.md`:** **IMMEDIATELY** after any action, update the plan to reflect the change (e.g., mark a position `SOLD` or an order `CANCELED`).
   - **üö® MANDATORY:** This is not optional. Every trade execution must be followed by an immediate plan update.

**4. Get Fresh Market Context (Optional but Recommended):**
   - If the market is volatile, get updated technical indicators.
     ```bash
     python main.py analysis indicators --coins ETH,SOL,BNB
     ```

### **Phase 4: Report**

**5. Generate a Status Report:**
   - Based on your findings, generate a concise report.
   - **If no action is needed:** "All positions are aligned with the plan and protected. Monitoring continues."
   - **If action is required:** "Action Needed: The `ETH` buy order has filled. Proceeding with the Post-Fill Drill."
   - **If there's a warning:** "Warning: `BNB` price is approaching the stop-loss. Monitor closely."

### **üö® CRITICAL: Plan Maintenance Protocol**

**GOLDEN RULE:** `current_plan.md` must **ALWAYS** reflect your live portfolio state. Any discrepancy is a risk.

**When to Update the Plan:**
- ‚úÖ **Order fills** - Mark orders as `FILLED` and update position values
- ‚úÖ **Order cancellations** - Mark orders as `CANCELED`
- ‚úÖ **New positions** - Add new asset holdings with protection status
- ‚úÖ **Position exits** - Mark positions as `SOLD` or `EXITED`
- ‚úÖ **Stop-loss/take-profit hits** - Update position status and cash values
- ‚úÖ **Portfolio value changes** - Update total portfolio value regularly
