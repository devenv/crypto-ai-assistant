# AI Trading Workflow - Strategic Development (v5.0)

This workflow uses **comprehensive deep research** for developing new trading strategies and executing complex market analysis.

**üîÑ ALL COINS ANALYSIS PRINCIPLE:**
- **NEVER analyze only "major holdings"** - include ALL portfolio positions above $1.00 (currently: BTC, SOL, TAO, FET, RAY)
- **Small positions matter**: Even positions under $50 can signal market shifts or need strategic analysis
- **Complete strategic coherence**: Entire portfolio should align with developed strategy, not just large positions
- **Comprehensive protection**: All positions should be evaluated for protective measures regardless of size

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL SAFETY & SETUP**

**üö® Before ANY trading:**
- **Backup private keys** securely
- **Never share API keys** or credentials
- **Start with small amounts** until confident
- **Double-check all commands** - financial mistakes are costly

**üíª Command Format:**
- **Windows:** `.\main.ps1` instead of `python main.py`
- **Unix/Linux/Mac:** `./main.sh` (or `python main.py`)
- **Examples:** `.\main.ps1 account info` or `./main.sh account info`

**üîç EXTERNAL AI ANALYSIS EVALUATION:**
After receiving analysis from external AI, evaluate quality and completeness:

| Analysis Quality | External AI Response | Next Action |
|------------------|---------------------|-------------|
| **Market Timing** | Vague timing guidance | Ask follow-up questions for precise entry/exit timing |
| **Risk Assessment** | Generic risk mentions | Request specific portfolio risk quantification |
| **Conflicting Signals** | Technical vs sentiment discord | Ask AI to resolve and prioritize recommendations |
| **Actionability** | Abstract recommendations | Request concrete order specifications and levels |
| **Regime Clarity** | Unclear market phase | Ask for explicit regime identification |
| **Protection Gaps** | Missing protection analysis | Request targeted protection recommendations |

**üéØ STAGE 2: EXTERNAL AI REFINEMENT (When Needed)**
If initial analysis lacks quality, use follow-up prompts with external AI:

**Follow-up Prompt Examples:**
- "Provide specific entry and exit levels for the opportunities you mentioned"
- "Quantify the portfolio concentration risk you identified with specific percentages"
- "Resolve the conflicting signals between technical and sentiment analysis"
- "Give concrete order specifications (price levels, quantities) for your recommendations"

**Stage 2 External AI Refinement Focus:**
- üéØ **Targeted Gap Resolution**: Address specific gaps identified from initial analysis
- ‚è∞ **Market Timing Precision**: Request enhanced timing analysis for optimal entry/exit
- üîç **Reality Validation**: Ask AI to validate insights against current portfolio state
- ‚öñÔ∏è **Priority Ranking**: Request clear prioritization of competing recommendations
- üìà **Regime Analysis**: Ask for explicit market regime identification and implications
- üõ°Ô∏è **Protection Strategy**: Request targeted protection recommendations with specifics

**üîÑ EXTERNAL AI ANALYSIS INTEGRATION:**
After receiving comprehensive analysis from external AI:

1. **Quality Assessment**: Evaluate analysis completeness and actionability (>75 = good)
2. **Gap Resolution**: Use follow-up prompts if key areas are missing or unclear
3. **Cross-Validation**: Optionally use multiple AI services for comparison
4. **Final Analysis**: Combine insights from all interactions for complete picture
5. **Decision Readiness**: Ensure analysis provides clear, actionable guidance

**üìä FINAL ANALYSIS PACKAGE:**
- **Primary Analysis**: Main strategic insights from external AI
- **Refinements**: Any follow-up clarifications or additional details
- **Quality Score**: Self-assessed completeness and actionability rating
- **Action Plan**: Clear next steps derived from AI analysis

### **Step 2: External AI Analysis Evaluation & Enhancement Decision**

**üìä EXTERNAL AI ANALYSIS EVALUATION**
Review external AI analysis results systematically:

1. **Data Integration**: Verify AI used provided portfolio, orders, and technical data effectively
2. **Strategic Clarity**: Assess clarity of market regime and timing guidance
3. **Actionability**: Evaluate specificity of recommendations and execution guidance
4. **Gap Identification**: Identify areas needing follow-up questions or clarification
5. **Quality Score**: Assess overall analysis quality and confidence level

**üîç EXTERNAL AI QUALITY ASSESSMENT PROTOCOL:**
- ‚úÖ **75-100**: High quality - proceed directly to Step 2.5 (Protection Assessment)
- üü° **60-74**: Good with gaps - **USE FOLLOW-UP PROMPTS** for targeted enhancement
- üö® **<60**: Insufficient - **TRY DIFFERENT AI SERVICE** or use manual analysis

**üìã GAP ANALYSIS BEFORE STAGE 2:**
When Stage 1 scores <75, identify specific improvement areas:

**Market Timing Gaps:**
- [ ] Entry/exit timing too vague or generic
- [ ] Conflicting timing signals not resolved
- [ ] Market regime unclear or not explicitly stated

**Actionability Gaps:**
- [ ] Recommendations too abstract for execution
- [ ] Missing specific price levels or quantities
- [ ] Protection strategy insufficient or unclear

**Risk Assessment Gaps:**
- [ ] Portfolio risk not quantified or contextualized
- [ ] Position sizing guidance missing or generic
- [ ] Risk/reward ratios not calculated

**Reality Alignment Gaps:**
- [ ] Recommendations don't account for existing orders
- [ ] Available balance not properly considered
- [ ] Current technical levels not integrated

**üéØ STAGE 2 ENHANCEMENT EXECUTION**
When Stage 2 is triggered, run enhanced analysis:

```bash
# Enhanced analysis targeting identified gaps:
python main.py ai market-timing
```

**Stage 2 Call Instructions:**
- Focus on specific gaps identified from Stage 1
- Request precise timing and entry/exit guidance
- Validate recommendations against current portfolio reality
- Provide concrete actionable recommendations with specifics

**üìä INTEGRATED ANALYSIS ASSESSMENT**
After Stage 2 completion, integrate both analyses:

**Integration Decision Matrix:**
- **Stage Alignment**: Do Stage 1 and Stage 2 agree on direction?
- **Conflict Resolution**: When stages disagree, prioritize Stage 2 (more targeted)
- **Complementary Insights**: Combine Stage 1 breadth with Stage 2 precision
- **Final Confidence**: Assess combined quality score

**Combined Analysis Quality Scoring:**
- ‚úÖ **80-100**: Excellent - high confidence execution
- üü° **65-79**: Good - proceed with minor adjustments
- üü† **50-64**: Adequate - careful execution with enhanced validation
- üö® **<50**: Insufficient - manual analysis fallback required

**üìù STRATEGIC INSIGHTS INTEGRATION**
Extract actionable intelligence from integrated analysis:

**Key Integration Questions:**
- **Market Direction**: What's the primary strategic direction (accumulate/protect/hold)?
- **Timing Precision**: When should actions be taken (immediate/on dips/on breaks)?
- **Risk Quantification**: What's the specific risk level of recommended actions?
- **Protection Strategy**: How should current positions be protected?
- **Cash Deployment**: How much and when should available USDT be deployed?

**Action Translation Examples:**
- üîç **"BTC accumulation opportunity"** ‚Üí Validate with `analysis indicators --coins BTC`
- üõ°Ô∏è **"SOL protection inadequate"** ‚Üí Check with `account orders --symbol SOLUSDT`
- ‚öñÔ∏è **"ETH profit-taking at $3,800"** ‚Üí Simulate with `validate order-simulation`
- üí∞ **"Deploy 30% cash on 5% dip"** ‚Üí Check with `validate balance-check USDT`

### **Step 2.5: Existing Protection Assessment** *(CRITICAL)*

üõ°Ô∏è **BEFORE acting on AI recommendations, evaluate existing protection:**

**Quick Protection Check:**
```bash
# Check existing orders for ALL portfolio positions mentioned in AI analysis
python main.py account orders --symbol SOLUSDT
python main.py account orders --symbol ETHUSDT
python main.py account orders --symbol BTCUSDT
python main.py account orders --symbol TAOUSDT
python main.py account orders --symbol FETUSDT
python main.py account orders --symbol RAYUSDT
```

**Protection Adequacy Decision Matrix:**

| Condition | Action | Rationale |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| **Sell orders within 5% of current price** | ‚úÖ SKIP protective recommendations | Already protected |
| **Sell orders cover >50% of position** | ‚úÖ SKIP or minimal adjustment | Adequate coverage |
| **Multiple protective price levels exist** | üîç EVALUATE incremental benefit | May be sufficient |
| **No protective orders within 10%** | ‚úÖ EXECUTE AI protection recommendations | Needs protection |

**Real Example from Our Session:**
- **SOL**: AI recommended OCO, but existing 5.0 SOL sell at $185 (current $183.83) = **EXCELLENT PROTECTION**
- **ETH**: AI recommended stop-loss, but existing sells at $3,750/$3,700 (current $3,647) = **GOOD PROTECTION**
- **Decision**: Skip protective orders, focus on BTC repositioning instead

**Protection Coverage Score (Quick Calculation):**
- Protective orders within 5% of current price: **+50 points**
- Orders cover majority of position: **+30 points**
- Multiple price levels protected: **+20 points**
- **Score >70**: Skip new protection orders
- **Score <70**: Implement AI recommendations

### **Step 3: Manual Analysis Fallback (When Both AI Stages Insufficient)**

```bash
# When integrated analysis scores <50 or AI systems fail:
python main.py account history ETHUSDT --limit 5    # Recent transaction patterns
python main.py account history BTCUSDT --limit 5    # Recent transaction patterns
python main.py account history SOLUSDT --limit 5    # Recent transaction patterns
python main.py account history TAOUSDT --limit 5    # Recent transaction patterns
python main.py account history FETUSDT --limit 5    # Recent transaction patterns
python main.py account history RAYUSDT --limit 5    # Recent transaction patterns
python main.py analysis indicators --coins BTC,SOL,TAO,FET,RAY  # Current technical state - ALL portfolio positions
```

**Manual Analysis Triggers:**
- **Combined analysis score <50** after both Stage 1 and Stage 2
- **Both AI stages fail** to provide adequate strategic guidance
- **AI systems unavailable** or malfunctioning during critical decisions
- **Extremely contradictory signals** that both stages cannot resolve
- **Time-sensitive protection issues** when AI analysis incomplete

**üîç Manual Analysis Protocol:**
1. **Protection Priority**: Identify any major positions (>20%) without protection <10%
2. **Technical Assessment**: Review RSI extremes (>80 or <20) requiring immediate action
3. **Balance Reality**: Confirm available USDT vs committed orders for new positions
4. **Risk Containment**: Focus on conservative actions that reduce portfolio risk
5. **Documentation**: Record all manual decisions for future AI training

**üìä Conservative Manual Decision Framework:**
- **Immediate Protection**: Place basic stop-losses for unprotected major positions
- **Order Cleanup**: Cancel obviously stale or conflicting orders
- **Cash Preservation**: Avoid new large deployments without clear technical signals
- **Plan Documentation**: Update plan with all manual actions and rationale

‚ö†Ô∏è **Manual Analysis Safety Rules:**
- **Use full trading pairs**: ETHUSDT, BTCUSDT, SOLUSDT (not abbreviated)
- **Conservative position sizing**: <10% portfolio for any new positions
- **Protection first**: Always prioritize risk management over opportunity
- **Document everything**: Essential for improving future AI analysis

### **Step 4: Strategic Action Plan Development**

üìã **STRATEGIC INSIGHTS TO ACTION PLAN**
Convert AI strategic analysis into specific, validated actions:

**Action Plan Development Process:**
1. **Extract Key Insights**: Identify specific opportunities/risks from AI analysis
2. **Technical Validation**: Verify with current indicators and market data
3. **Protection Review**: Assess adequacy using existing orders
4. **Balance Validation**: Confirm available funds for any new positions
5. **Risk Assessment**: Ensure alignment with risk tolerance

**Example Action Plan Creation:**

**From AI Insight**: *"BTC showing strong accumulation opportunity with RSI at 42, institutional flows positive"*

**Validation Steps:**
```bash
# 1. Verify current technical state
python main.py analysis indicators --coins BTC

# 2. Check available USDT for accumulation
python main.py validate balance-check USDT

# 3. Review existing BTC orders
python main.py account orders --symbol BTCUSDT

# 4. Simulate potential accumulation order
python main.py validate order-simulation BTCUSDT BUY LIMIT 0.004 --price 115000
```

**Documented Plan:**
```markdown
BTC ACCUMULATION OPPORTUNITY
- Rationale: AI identifies RSI 42 + institutional flows
- Technical Validation: ‚úÖ RSI confirmed at 42.2 (Strong Buy signal)
- Available Funds: ‚úÖ $877 USDT available
- Existing Protection: ‚úÖ Sell order at $130K provides upside protection
- Proposed Action: BUY 0.004 BTC at $115,000 (~$460 USDT)
- Risk Level: LOW (position stays <25% portfolio)
```

**FINALIZATION CHECKLIST**
- [ ] Strategic insights align with risk tolerance
- [ ] Technical indicators support AI analysis
- [ ] Protective orders adequate for new positions
- [ ] Available balance confirmed for all planned actions
- [ ] No conflicts with existing orders identified

### **Step 5: Pre-Execution Validation (Advanced)**

üõ°Ô∏è **AUTOMATED VALIDATION TOOLS**
```bash
# Validate AI recommendations before execution:
python main.py validate ai-recommendations '[JSON_RECOMMENDATIONS]'

# Check available balance:
python main.py validate balance-check ETH

# Simulate order before placing:
python main.py validate order-simulation ETHUSDT SELL LIMIT 0.0439 --price 3650
```

### **Step 6: Systematic Execution**

üéØ **EXECUTION PROTOCOL**
Execute actions one by one with immediate documentation:

```bash
# 1. Execute command
python main.py order place-limit ETHUSDT SELL 0.2409 3800

# 2. IMMEDIATELY update current_plan.md with Order ID
# 3. Only then proceed to next action
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL RULE:** Update `current_plan.md` immediately after each command.

### **Step 7: Post-Execution Verification**

üîç **POST-EXECUTION VERIFICATION PROTOCOL**

**A. Verify Orders Exist:**
```bash
python main.py account orders
```

**B. Check for Unexpected Fills:**
```bash
python main.py account info
python main.py account history ETHUSDT --limit 3
```

**C. Plan Reconciliation:**
Ensure `current_plan.md` accurately reflects live portfolio state.

### **Step 8: Transition to Monitoring**

Switch to **crypto-monitoring-workflow.md** for ongoing daily oversight.

## üöÄ **ADVANCED FEATURES & AUTOMATION**

### **Validation Commands**

```bash
# AI recommendation validation (100-point scoring):
python main.py validate ai-recommendations '[JSON]'

# Order simulation (prevent critical errors):
python main.py validate order-simulation SYMBOL SIDE TYPE QTY [--price PRICE]

# Balance verification (prevent insufficient balance):
python main.py validate balance-check ASSET
```

### **Protective Order Strategy Guide**

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Understand Order Types for Protection**

| Order Type | Purpose | When Price Executes | Example Use Case |
|------------|---------|-------------------|------------------|
| **LIMIT SELL** | Take profit | When market reaches or exceeds your price | Profit-taking: SELL LIMIT at $110 (current $100) |
| **OCO SELL** | Dual protection | Either take-profit OR stop-loss hits | Protection: Take-profit $110, Stop-loss $90 |

**Protective Order Examples:**
```bash
# ‚úÖ CORRECT: OCO for downside protection + upside capture
python main.py validate order-simulation ETHUSDT SELL OCO 0.5 --price 3800 --stop-price 3400
# Result: Sells at $3800 (profit) OR $3400 (protection)

# ‚ùå WRONG: LIMIT SELL below market (executes immediately)
python main.py validate order-simulation ETHUSDT SELL LIMIT 0.5 --price 3400  # Current: $3600
# Result: Immediate execution, no protection

# ‚úÖ CORRECT: LIMIT SELL above market (profit-taking only)
python main.py validate order-simulation ETHUSDT SELL LIMIT 0.5 --price 3800  # Current: $3600
# Result: Waits for $3800, no downside protection
```

**Protection Strategy Decision Matrix:**
- **Need downside protection?** ‚Üí Use OCO orders
- **Only profit-taking?** ‚Üí Use LIMIT SELL above market
- **Small position (<1% portfolio)?** ‚Üí Consider if protection overhead is worthwhile

### **Plan Synchronization Protocol**

**üö® GOLDEN RULE:** `current_plan.md` = Single Source of Truth

**Update Triggers:**
- ‚úÖ Every order placement ‚Üí Document Order ID immediately
- ‚úÖ Every order cancellation ‚Üí Mark CANCELED with timestamp
- ‚úÖ Every order fill ‚Üí Update position, mark FILLED
- ‚úÖ Portfolio value changes ‚Üí Update totals

**Active Order Registry Template:**
```markdown
| Asset | Order ID | Type | Side | Price | Quantity | Status | Entry Time | Notes |
|-------|----------|------|------|-------|----------|---------|------------|-------|
| ETH   | 32643068755 | LIMIT | SELL | 3550 | 0.012 | ACTIVE | 20:59 | Profit ladder |
| BTC   | 46167771039 | LIMIT | BUY | 112000 | 0.00267 | ACTIVE | 20:59 | Support buy |

## üîÑ **TRANSITION TO MONITORING MODE**

### **When Strategic Work is Complete**

**After completing Step 8 (Post-Execution Verification), transition to ongoing monitoring:**

**Final Strategic Session Tasks:**
1. **Complete Plan Update:** Ensure `current_plan.md` reflects all executed trades
2. **Document Strategy:** Note key decisions and rationale for future reference
3. **Set Monitoring Schedule:** Based on market volatility and position sizes
4. **Establish Triggers:** Define when to return to strategic mode

**Monitoring Setup Checklist:**
```bash
# Verify all orders are properly tracked
python main.py account orders

# Confirm positions are protected
# (All major positions should have stop-losses or planned exits)

# Test monitoring command
python main.py ai analyze-portfolio --mode monitoring

# Set next strategic review date (typically 1-2 weeks)
```

### **Monitoring Mode Guidelines**

**For ongoing oversight after strategic execution:**

**Daily Monitoring Approach:**
- **Command:** `python main.py ai analyze-portfolio --mode monitoring`

- ‚úÖ Monitoring command tested and working for complete portfolio
- ‚úÖ Next strategic review scheduled with ALL positions considerations
- ‚úÖ Emergency escalation triggers defined for every position
- ‚úÖ Plan documentation complete and current for entire portfolio

### **Quality Metrics for Strategic Work**

**Target Performance Standards:**
- **Analysis Quality:** AI validation scores >80 consistently
- **Execution Accuracy:** Orders placed correctly >99% of time
- **Plan Synchronization:** Plan accuracy >98% after execution
- **Risk Management:** ALL portfolio positions protected appropriately (major positions >20% within 10%, smaller positions evaluated for protection needs)
- **Documentation Quality:** Plan reflects reality within 2% variance

**Monthly Strategic Review Questions:**
1. **Effectiveness:** Are strategic decisions improving portfolio performance?
2. **Process:** Is the 8-step workflow being followed consistently?
3. **Risk Management:** Are protective measures working as intended?
4. **Integration:** Is transition to monitoring working smoothly?
5. **Evolution:** What workflow improvements have been identified?

### **Account Management**
```bash
python main.py account info                           # Portfolio overview
python main.py account orders [--symbol SYMBOL]      # Active orders
python main.py account history SYMBOL [--limit N]    # Trade history
```

### **Order Management**
```bash
python main.py order place-limit SYMBOL SIDE QTY PRICE    # Limit order
python main.py order place-market SYMBOL SIDE QTY         # Market order
python main.py order place-oco SYMBOL QTY PRICE STOP      # OCO order (SELL only)
python main.py order cancel order SYMBOL ID               # Cancel single order
python main.py order cancel oco SYMBOL LIST_ID            # Cancel OCO order
```

### **Analysis & AI**
```bash
python main.py analysis indicators --coins COIN_LIST      # Technical indicators
python main.py ai analyze-portfolio --mode strategy       # Generate prompts for external AI
python main.py ai analyze-portfolio --mode monitoring     # Quick monitoring analysis
python main.py ai market-timing                          # Market timing analysis
```

### **Validation & Safety**
```bash
python main.py validate ai-recommendations '[JSON]'       # Validate AI suggestions
python main.py validate order-simulation ARGS             # Simulate order placement
python main.py validate balance-check ASSET               # Check available balance
```

**üéØ KEY PRINCIPLE:** This workflow prioritizes systematic strategy development with comprehensive analysis of ALL portfolio positions above $1.00. Strategy mode now generates comprehensive prompts for external AI services (ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, etc.) rather than making automatic API calls. This provides cost control, service flexibility, and complete transparency. For daily monitoring, use `crypto-monitoring-workflow.md` which focuses on quick health checks and actionable issues only.

**üîÑ RESILIENCE:** If any command fails or gets interrupted, retry the command as needed to complete each workflow step fully before proceeding to the next step. Complete workflow integrity is essential for strategic success.
