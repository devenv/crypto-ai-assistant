## TEST 2: Technical Analysis Depth and Precision
```
TECHNICAL ANALYSIS CHALLENGE - January 18, 2025

You are a professional crypto trader. Analyze this setup:

**Ethereum (ETH)**
- Current Price: $3,448
- RSI (14): 83.13
- Position: Above 20, 50, 200 EMAs

- Volume: 15% above 30-day average
- Support: $3,200, $2,932, $2,436
- Resistance: $3,500, $3,650

**Critical Question**: With RSI at 83.13 (extremely overbought), provide:
1. Exact probability of 10% correction in next 48 hours
2. Specific entry/exit levels for long and short positions
3. Risk management strategy with exact stop-loss levels
4. Position sizing for $10,000 allocation
5. Timeline for RSI normalization below 70

Be specific with numbers, not generic advice.
```

## TEST 3: Portfolio Optimization with Constraints
```
PORTFOLIO REBALANCING CHALLENGE - January 18, 2025

Current Portfolio: $6,523 total
- BTC: 23.1% ($1,504)
- ETH: 3.8% ($248)
- SOL: 34.7% ($2,260)
- BNB: 4.1% ($266)
- TAO: 0.8% ($49)

**Constraints:**

- SOL concentration too high at 34.7%

**Required Output:**
1. Exact trades to execute (quantities and prices)
2. Target allocation percentages after rebalancing
3. Timeline for execution (which trades first/last)
4. Risk mitigation orders (stop-losses, OCOs)
5. Expected portfolio beta reduction

Provide specific buy/sell orders, not general advice.
```

## TEST 4: Complex Scenario Analysis
```
CRYPTO MARKET SCENARIO MODELING - January 18, 2025

Model three scenarios for the next 30 days:

**Scenario 1: Bull Continuation (40% probability)**
- BTC breaks $120k, reaches $135k
- ETH rallies to $3,800 despite current RSI 83.13
- SOL maintains strength to $200
- Market drivers: Trump policies, ETF inflows

**Scenario 2: Healthy Correction (45% probability)**
- BTC pulls back to $105k-$110k support
- ETH corrects 20-25% from overbought levels
- SOL tests $157 support
- Market drivers: Profit-taking, RSI cooling

**Scenario 3: Sharp Selloff (15% probability)**
- BTC falls to $95k-$98k
- ETH drops 35-40%
- SOL crashes to $126 support
- Market drivers: Regulatory fears, macro shock

For EACH scenario, calculate:
1. Portfolio value impact on the $6,523 portfolio above
2. Which assets to buy/sell NOW to optimize for each scenario
3. Hedging strategies for downside scenarios
4. Probability-weighted expected return

Show all calculations.
```

## TEST 5: DeFi Strategy with Real APY Data
```
DEFI YIELD OPTIMIZATION - January 18, 2025

With $2,188 USDT available, find the best yield strategies:

**Assets Available:** SOL, BTC, ETH, BNB, TAO, USDT

**Required Research:**
1. Current staking APY for SOL, ETH, BNB (liquid vs traditional)
2. Current lending rates on Aave, Compound for USDT
3. Cross-chain yield farming opportunities
4. Liquid staking derivative yields (stETH, mSOL, etc.)
5. Risk-adjusted returns for each strategy

**Deliverable:**
- Specific platform recommendations with current APY rates
- Risk assessment (smart contract, impermanent loss, etc.)
- Optimal allocation across strategies
- Expected annual yield and monthly income
- Exit strategies for each position

Must include current, real APY data - not outdated examples.
```

## TEST 6: Risk Management Deep Dive
```
CRYPTO RISK ASSESSMENT - January 18, 2025

Analyze maximum drawdown scenarios for this portfolio:

**Holdings:** $6,523 total (BTC 23.1%, ETH 3.8%, SOL 34.7%, BNB 4.1%, TAO 0.8%, Cash 33.5%)

**Risk Scenarios:**
1. 50% crypto market crash (all assets drop 50%)
2. SOL-specific crash (40% drop due to network issues)
3. ETH correction (30% drop from RSI 83.13 overbought)
4. Correlation breakdown (assets move independently)
5. Black swan event (80% crypto crash like 2018)

For each scenario:
1. Calculate exact portfolio loss in dollars and percentage
2. Identify which positions cause most damage
3. Propose specific hedging instruments (derivatives, shorts, etc.)
4. Calculate hedge costs vs protection provided
5. Design an optimal protection strategy

Show all mathematical calculations.
