        **MACRO FOUNDATION**: The Crypto Fear & Greed Index currently sits at 45/100 showing neutral sentiment.
        Recent institutional flows show $150M outflows from Bitcoin ETFs while Ethereum sees $75M inflows.
        Bitcoin dominance has declined to 58.2%, indicating selective altcoin season rotation.

        **PORTFOLIO RISK ASSESSMENT**: Concentration considerations â€“ BTC allocation at 52.3% is unusually high
        relative to diversification best practices; consider gradual rebalancing using existing sell orders.

        **COMPREHENSIVE TECHNICAL ANALYSIS**: ETH showing support at $3,480 with resistance at $3,650.
        LINK in falling wedge pattern with breakout above $16.20 targeting $30. DOT consolidating near
        $3.55 support with breakout potential above $3.80. ADA oversold at $0.68 with support at $0.66.
        AVAX approaching triangle apex at $18 support. UNI needs validation above $9.50.
        XRP mixed signals with support at $2.76.

        **RISK MANAGEMENT PRIORITIES**: Address BTC overweight position first before new deployment.
        Implement stop-losses below key support levels. Maintain 30% USDT reserves.

        **STRATEGIC OPPORTUNITIES**: Conservative accumulation near technical support levels.
        Entry at ETH $3,480, LINK $15.80, with stops below $3,250 and $15.40 respectively.
        Monitor for DOT breakout above $3.80 for 25% rally potential.
